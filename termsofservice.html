      <h2>TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS</h2>
      <p>
        By downloading, browsing, accessing, or using this MinesweepAR Application (“MinesweepAR Mobile Application”),
        you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions of Use. We reserve the right to amend these terms and conditions
        at any time. If you disagree with any of these Terms and Conditions of Use, you must immediately discontinue your
        access to the MinesweepAR Mobile Application and your use of the services offered on the MinesweepAR Mobile
        Application. Continued use of the MinesweepAR Mobile Application will constitute acceptance of these Terms and
        Conditions of Use, as may be amended from time to time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="terms-to-use">
      <h2>TERMS TO USE</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We are committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right
          to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for
          the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
        </li>
        <li>
          User should clearly accept to only be allowed to use some features (like managing production and finance of a batch of
          chick) according to his stock of the plan (subscription) for example to plan and put under production they need to have
          at least 1 stock of the plan (size of the batch).
        </li>
        <li>
          User should clearly accept us to share with our other partners (veterinary, reseller, seller, bank, production
          organization, etc...). Their production and finance management data to help him to better manage and sell faster his
          production.
        </li>
        <li>
          User should accept clearly that we do not guarantee the selling of his production through the app MinesweepAR.
        </li>
        <li>
          User should clearly accept and do if he/she free to do the automatic recommendations from our app or from our veterinary
          partners and engage only his responsibility, not our company or our veterinary partners
        </li>
        <li>
          The MinesweepAR app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service.
          It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not
          jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
          official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
          compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the MinesweepAR app won’t work properly or at all.
        </li>
        <li>
          We cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays
          charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, we cannot accept responsibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is available for Android and iOS– the requirements for the system
          (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to
          download the updates if you want to keep using the app. It is your responsibility to keep the app version up to date.
          We do not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the version that
          you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you,
          we may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
          termination to you.
        </li>
        <li>
          We strongly recommend that you only download the MinesweepAR applications from the Play Store or App Store. Doing so
          will ensure that your apps are legitimate and safe from malicious software.
